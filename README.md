# Handy git pre commits


Starting this as a nice way to keep my pre commits easy to find rather than combing through old repositories...laziness to be honest


## Python

- black
		- Runs black on files about to be commited
- ruff
		- Runs riff on the files about to be commited
		- Remember to define your rules
		- Personal preference for larger python projects
